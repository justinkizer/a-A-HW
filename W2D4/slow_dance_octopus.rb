# Dancing Octopus
#
# Full of fish, the Octopus attempts Dance Dance Revolution. The game has tiles in the following directions:
#
# tiles_array = ["up", "right-up", "right", "right-down", "down", "left-down", "left",  "left-up" ]
# To play the game, the octopus must step on a tile with her corresponding tentacle. We can assume that the octopus's eight tentacles are numbered and correspond to the tile direction indices.

# Slow Dance
#
# Given a tile direction, iterate through a tiles array to return the tentacle number (tile index) the octopus must move. This should take O(n) time.
#
# slow_dance("up", tiles_array)
# > 0
#
# slow_dance("right-down", tiles_array)
# > 3

def slow_dance(direction, tiles_array)
  tiles_array.each_with_index do |tile, tentacle|
    return tentacle if tile == direction
  end
end
